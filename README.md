# AnnihilationPro

A Minecraft plugin from the old days, now dusted off and given a slightly less painful build setup.  
I took the ancient, messy Eclipse project files and converted them into a modern IntelliJ + Maven structure.  
(No more `.classpath` nightmares.)

## Disclaimer
If you run into errors – that’s on you.  
No support will be provided.  
The bare minimum environment is already prepared, so just fix the dependencies and it should compile… probably.  
(It’s easy. Probably.)
